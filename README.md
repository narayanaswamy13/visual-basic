Visual Basic is probably the most practical language I've learned, and one that I use on a daily basis (probably becuase I don't fully know the capabilites of other languages yet).

Pretty much anything that is online can be scraped, imported, formatted, manipulated, analyzed, and interpreted using Visual Basic.

I don't really want to upload my more elaborate scripts up here. But I will upload some pretty useful subroutines that I often use in alot of my scripts.
