# excel macros

I'm not entirely sure if these are bas files but I wrote them in the visual basic devolper of Excel and uploaded them here.

* BasicSearch.bas
  * basic word search, finds the phrase you're looking for and activates the cell containing that phrase
* InternetExplorer.bas
  * defines Internet Explorer, creates a window, navigates to a URL
* QueryTables.bas
  * creates a temp page, creates a new query table on the temp page based off a specificed URL
* clubSearch.bas
* createTable.bas
* moveYN.bas

* rename.bas
  * a loop that renames local files
* ynSearchLoop.bas
  * i wrote this to format data copied from website back into a table-esque format
