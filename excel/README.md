# excel macros

I'm not entirely sure if these work as bas files but I wrote them in the visual basic devolper of Excel and uploaded them here.

* BasicSearch.bas
  * basic word search, finds the phrase you're looking for and activates the cell containing that phrase
* InternetExplorer.bas
  * defines Internet Explorer, creates a window, navigates to a URL
* QueryTables.bas
  * creates a temp page, creates a new query table on the temp page based off a specificed URL
* clubSearch.bas
 * this looks for a cells containing a phrase and shifts them to the right
* createTable.bas
 * this turns a column of data  into a table using a target phrase
* moveYN.bas
 * formats a row a cell contains the word "yes" or "no"
* rename.bas
  * a loop that renames local files
* ynSearchLoop.bas
  * runs through a column looking for "yes" or "no", for every true instance it creates a row beneath and inserts a target phrase
